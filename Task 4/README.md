Unfortunately, I lacked time to fully understand how to work with geographic images and their masking, so my ipynb file is very poor. However, I am grateful that I learned how to use rasterio library to open raster images and partially understood and learned how to mask geographical images and work with them.<br>
I also liked researching soil erosion indicators and their detection. Due to the lack of time, the solution research paper is also not of the best quality, but if I had opportunity to work more on this during the internship I would be very grateful and do my best to continue my work in a better quality.
